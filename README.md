# simple-vue-select
A simple select box for a project i'm currently working.

It has 2 styles, one with SVG Icons added and one with just text.
SVG were added with the tag <use> which uses external SVGs.
As such, its necessary to add an ID to the SVG tag in the file. The ID used here is #layer.

Also added an option to disable the select.
